        <p>Welcome to our Senior/Graduate Project page. The focus of this project is to utilize a large set of data and
            learn to visualize it using one of the many visualization languages. For the sake of this project, we have
            chosen to use D3 and JavaScript. The data we have chosen to visualize contains information on the
            universities across the U.S. We are going to create some form of an interactive map that users to access the
            data visually. We will update this page when we begin to implement our prototype.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The United States College Information System Project is under the progress. 
            <br/>All team members contribute to this part.
            <br/>The USCI Project aims to utilize the gathered information of the institutions throughout the United States to create different visualizations. Rather than be intimidated and confused by the large data set, our users will be able to visualize institutions on a geographical map and find out specific information on each institute. They will be able to compare different values of institutes such as tuition cost, total revenue, grants awarded, and many other criteria that are available. This implementation will be in the form of a website and be written using the D3 (a JavaScript based language).

        <p>Each member has been working on their individual prototypes with D3.js during the process of implementing the
            greater app. Here are links to each members visualizations:
            <br/>Yi Wang's Prototypes:
            <br/>This visualization uses a scatterplot to show the correlation between five categories of the users
            choosing. The choices are tuition cost, total revenue, number of students enrolled, total employees, and
            control (private, public, etc). The data set used contains the top 50 universities based on total revenue.
