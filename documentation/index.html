 <h3>Mission and Scope</h3>

 <dl>

   <dd class="sample1">Information is  important for people to make decisions, but in most cases people get raw data. Raw data are useful but is hard to understand whenever there are too many values. It is because of this that data visualization has become increasingly important over the years. </dd>
  
  <dd class="sample1">Choosing a good university is one of the most important decision in life. But most university information websites do not provide any visualization method to help user to understand the data. This is why we want to design this project to help students and parents.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>


  <dt>Goal of this project</dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>

  <dd class="sample1">In order to allow the user to access the data in a more meaningful way, our project aims to utilize the gathered information of the institutions throughout the United States to create different visualizations. Our users will be able to visualize institutions on a geographical map and find out specific information on each institute. They will be able to compare different values of institutes such as tuition cost, total revenue, grants awarded, and many other criteria that are available using different visualizations. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>


  <dt>Where should a new team member start?</dt>

  <dd>A new member could alwasy contribute to this project by adding new visualizations. Visualizations are stand alone JavaScript file so it is easy for any developer to start working on this project. </dd>

 <h3>Status</h3>
 
 <div class="sample1">
 <p>Currently, we have implemented all functions of USCI system.
 <p>We have created a scatter plot chart, a bar chart, a scatterplot matrix chart, a parallel coordinator chart, a pie chart and a map for the visualization module.</p>
 <p>Also, we have finished user tests and have received all feedbacks from the testers.</p>

 <p>The next major milestone is a larger dataset for visualization module and a wider set of testers.</p>
