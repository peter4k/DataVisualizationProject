                    <strong>Process impact:</strong> This document is a brief and fairly
                    technical discussion of how the system works under ideal conditions.
                    It is also known as a "theory of operation" document.  It should
                    describe key algorithms, technology dependencies, and operational
                    issues.  Much of the content of this document can be drawn from
                    design documents.  This document will be used by the QA, technical
                    support, and operations groups.  The goal is to give those groups
                    the information they need to understand, manage, or begin to
                    troubleshoot the system (i.e., recognize certain behavior as normal
                    or abnormal).  If significantly more information is needed, it
                    should be organized into a larger "operations guide".

                    <h3>Implementation of Specific modules</h3>
                    
                    
                    <ul class="sample1">
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> scatter plot</li>
                         <li>user can select different values for x-axes and y-axes (revenue, tuition, total enrollments, total employees). We use blue circles to present public universities and red circles to present private universities. Also, the user can check the university's name of each circle on the scatter plot chart if user moves the moues on one of these circles. Besides, the program will make the other circles' color become transparent but except the ones which user enters from search function.</li>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> pie chart</li>
                        <li>user can compare different universities with different values. To start, the user needs to enter universities' names by using the search function. The user can see a "pie" on the webpage once they enter at least one university's name. The pie chart can support a total number of 9 different universities for comparison at the same time. In addition, the user can also select the value they want to check. The pie chart's data will be updated once they select a new value tag from the topside of the page. Also, the user can check the specific values if user move the mouse over on one section and the hover texts will be shown around the pie chart. Besides, the universities' names and their color boxes will be shown on the left side of the webpage for helping user to figure which universities are being compared.</li>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> parallel coordinator chart</li>
                        <li>there are 4 different y-axes (but no x-axes) for showing the trends of a plenty of universities with different values (revenue, tuition, total enrollment, total employees) at the same time. We use blue lines to present public universities and red lines to present private universities on the chart. The user can select a line by moving the mouse on it and they can see a hover text with the specific values that is shown on the right side of the webpage.  Also, the user can "highlight" a line by using the searching function. The program will make the other lines' color become transparent but except the ones which user enters from search function.</li>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> bar chart </li>
                        <li>We have y-axes to show the values of universities and x axes to list all top 50 universities' names. The y-axes will be updated if user selects a different data's value. Again, we use blue to stand for public universities and red to stand for private universities. Also, the user can also sort the bar chart by clicking the "sort" button on the webpage (we also provide a "reset" for resetting the bar chart). Besides, the program will make the other bars' color become transparent but except the ones which user enters from search function.</li>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Map</li>
                        <li> we locate all universities on our U.S map by using black circles. The circles' color is transparent, so user can easily figure out which area has more universities. The states' colors are depending on the values (revenue, tuition, total enrollments, total employees which can be selected on the topside of the webpage) and the colors' domain is from yellow to red. Thus, the yellow area are those states which their values are much lower than the mean value of all nation's while the red area are the states which the values are higher than the mean value of all nation's. </li>
